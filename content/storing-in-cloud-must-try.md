## Which cloud?
Any cloud storage as long as it's not the cloud that can cause rain. Goole Drive, OneDrive, DropBox, etc you name it.

## Origin
Once upon a time, when a friend of mine told me "Cloud is new best friend". So i was thinking to give it a try. Back then i thought by separating disk is enough for data backup-ing (Like C: and D:); but in fact, your local disk could be corrupted, your laptop could be stolen, your data could lost. Since at the time i am writing this, I was a final-year student that love my Final Year Project so much, i can't afford to lose my data, **_I need backup_**.

## What did i do?
I connected my Office Apps (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.) to OneDrive

_"Why OneDrive?"_
Because as a student, i was granted 1TB of OneDrive space

##What I feel good about?
###1. Place-less working
Ever since I put my important docs such as Thesis, Internship Report and other i-can't-lose document, i can do it from anywhere anytime, because it is sync in the cloud.
For example, at home i can do my Thesis with my Desktop PC, but when i go out to somewhere i can bring my laptop along and access the work from the cloud or even accessing it from my mobile phone. 
When i store my docs in cloud, i can save it, turn-off my PC and just walk away bringing my laptop because the data is in the cloud.
If i store it in my PC-local-disk, i should copy-paste it to my laptop first before going out, or maybe store it in a flash drive that i should carry around (more stuffs to be carried).

###2. Safety(?)
At least, physical safeness is pretty much guaranteed.
Imagine a scenario, where your house get robbed and Cloud Data Center get robbed.
In your house, you could lost your laptop or PC, leading to lose of data.
In Cloud Data Center, even if they get robbed (_which is not likely to happen_), Cloud Data Center guaranteed duplication or backup of your data to fulfill the Service Level Agreement and Standard Operation Procedure and Disaster Prevention.
This also point back to previous part about flash drive, i might lose my flash drive too, it's small-in-shape.
Some Cloud Storage provider even provide version rollback and history of editing. If you working on document that involved several people, this feature will be useful to hunt who is making bad changes and praise the one that making good changes.

##My Concern
###1. I need internet
Because the docs is in the cloud, of course you need internet to synchronize the data between your local disk and cloud. If i am about go out, i need to make sure i have internet-data to access my data in the cloud (_at least, to download it, and edit it locally, and then upload it again_).

###2. Small-small no problem
Since it require internet connection, i do not recommend to upload big-chunk of data to Cloud storage, like movie or anime collections, because i personally live in an area that do not have high-speed internet speed. That is why, so far i only use it to backup documents, excel file, or power point. Only at certain time i need to share video of work or pictures, that i upload it to cloud storage.
Internet is not the only problem, price is also the problem. Some cloud storage offer 1-15 GB of storage at free tier. This might not be a problem if you only use cloud storage for storing documents, excel, or power point, but if you use cloud storage as a backup solution, you will need more than 15GB especially if you are storing videos or pictures.

##Conclusion
So far, i use cloud storage to store my important document in hope it will be physically safer and less chance of corrupted. For storing videos and pictures i still use local disk (HDD or SSD). But if you want to back-up some precious memories to cloud, it's okay, your choice.
